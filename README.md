This is the repository for our paper 'Fiducial Marker Detection in General Point Cloud with Intensity'.<br>

The existing LiDAR fiducial marker systems have apparent usage restrictions: <br>

Moreover, with no spatial marker placement requirement, fiducial marker detection in the general point cloud remains an unsolved problem. The general point cloud here refers to, but is not limited to, the 3D map built by Simultaneous Localization and Mapping or the 3D point cloud generated from Structure from Motion. The following video 



In this work, we introduce a strong generic LiDAR fiducial
marker detection algorithm that has no restrictions on marker
placement (the limitation of [LiDARTag](https://github.com/UMich-BipedLab/LiDARTag)) and does not
require that the spherical projection be applicable to the
inputted point cloud (the limitation of [IILFM](https://github.com/York-SDCNLab/IILFM)).
